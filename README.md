# glide_text2im_train
Training code to train model described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741 (you should start with your own transformer though, or load the one given in https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im/


This code is super janky, and I've only tested this in [this](https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorchlightning/pytorch_lightning/base-cuda-py3.9-torch1.10/images/sha256-1d66a17ff9dc8a8bf1a7258551a680e9dc802899ca1c511ddba78deeeda34026?context=explore) docker container.
